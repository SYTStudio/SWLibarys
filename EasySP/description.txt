EasySP is a lightweight, open-source SharedPreferences wrapper for Android written entirely in Java. It simplifies data storage with one-line put() and get() methods, automatic initialization, and blazing-fast in-memory caching — all without context passing.

Built for developers who want a smarter and safer way to handle app data, EasySP supports object serialization via Gson, optional AES-256 encryption, real-time key change listeners, and full JSON export/import for seamless backups or migrations.

You can store primitives, strings, or complex objects with a single call, while keeping everything fast, secure, and readable. The library is fully offline, requires no API, and integrates perfectly into both Android Studio and Sketchware Pro environments.
